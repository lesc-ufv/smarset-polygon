Ether Rock (https://etherrock.com) is one of the first crypto collectible NFT projects, from 2017. Only 100 rocks are ever available; many have already been sold at the time of writing. Each rock gets progressively more expensive. Once you own a rock, you can sell it, gift it to someone else, or hold on to it forever.

This is a contract to airdrop Ether Rock tokens.
